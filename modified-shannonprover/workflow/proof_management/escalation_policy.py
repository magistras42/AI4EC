"""System-decided adaptive surface escalation.

Extracted from ``ProofNodeManager`` (audit §8 #8): the manager used to hold the
adaptive-escalation state (a handful of ``_adaptive_*`` fields + two trace-tuned
magic numbers) and the three methods that drive it directly in its ``__init__``.
This concentrates that one concern in a single owner.

Policy: escalation is SYSTEM-decided, never agent-pulled. An "adaptive" run
profile starts the agent on a cheap L1 base surface and flips ONCE, latched, to
the richer escalate target the moment the agent has OBJECTIVELY stalled —
``_stall_threshold`` turns without committed progress, or a hard cap of
``_hard_cap_turns`` total turns. Easy lemmas advance every turn, never escalate,
and stay on the lean surface (kept off any heavier panels); hard lemmas stall and
earn the full surface. The agent cannot unlock tools on demand: reaching for a
gated intent in the cheap phase is rejected with guidance (``reach_block``) and
counts as a no-progress turn, which is itself what nudges toward auto-escalation.

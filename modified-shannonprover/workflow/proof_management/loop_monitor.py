"""Local-patch / no-progress loop detection (the manager's "mechanism CATCH").

Extracted from ``ProofNodeManager`` (audit §8 #8): the manager used to hold ~10
``_patch_loop_*`` fields, three trace-tuned magic numbers, and the ~230-line
``_inject_patch_loop_signal`` directly. This concentrates that one stateful
concern — an episode-latched detector that surfaces a neutral ``local_patch_loop``
banner — in a single owner.

The detector is FLAG-ONLY: it writes a neutral entry into the turn view's
``decision_context``; it never gates a turn and never raises (any internal failure
is swallowed so the banner simply does not appear).

Window sizing (``window=24``): the real step4_1 MACRO-CYCLE has ~10-11 distinct
fingerprints (period ~11); each member is re-reached by an accepted commit about
once per cycle, so K(=3) separated arrivals of one member span ~22 turns — a
24-turn window covers that with margin. ``detect_patch_loop`` is a PURE function
that would re-fire on every later accepted re-arrival inside the window; the
EPISODE LATCH (``_armed``) bounds it to ONE fire per loop episode.

Episode latch + re-arm (``rearm_after=2``): on first fire we disarm and capture
the loop-set (the fingerprints reached by ACCEPTED commits in the window;
state-frozen turns — rejected / read-only / repair — re-render a member's view
but are not themselves loop states). We re-arm only after a GENUINE escape: >= R
accepted commits land OUTSIDE the captured loop-set without an accepted return in
between (so a lone 1-turn excursion does not re-arm, and neither does parking on
one new frozen fingerprint via rejected turns — the audited any-turn counter
double-fired exactly there), OR a game-pair restructure (``_RESTRUCTURE_HEADS``),
OR an undo/restart intent (``_REARM_INTENTS``).

Episode escalation (``escalate_after=22``): while the latch stays disarmed — the
episode persists, no escape / restructure / undo re-armed it — count the turns
since the fire; at >= the threshold surface EXACTLY ONE stronger banner, then stay
silent for the rest of the episode (hard cap 2 banners/episode). 22 was tuned on
the real step4_1 resume Tree_0_0 trace (fire t34 -> escalation t56).

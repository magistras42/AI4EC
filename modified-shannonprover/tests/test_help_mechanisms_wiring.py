r"""Wiring tests for the two verifier-grounded help mechanisms (flag-only):

  CORRECT — `up_to_bad_call` is written into a workspace view's `decision_context`
  by the pure-view enrichment when the current goal post admits a `\/ bad` disjunct
  AND a lockstep `call (_: inv)` move is on offer.

  CATCH — `local_patch_loop` is injected into the returned ManagedTurn's view by
  LoopMonitor.inject across a frozen accepted-patch loop, and is NOT injected when
  `remaining` decreases.

These exercise the actual hook points (the pure helpers have their own unit tests in
test_up_to_bad_coherence.py / test_patch_loop_detector.py)."""

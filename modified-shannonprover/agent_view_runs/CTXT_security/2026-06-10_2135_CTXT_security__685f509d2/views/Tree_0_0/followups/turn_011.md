## Pure Logic — close with smt / rewrite

**Goal operators:**
- `eK`
- `_p`
- `ptxt`
- `equiv`
- `E.enc`
- `Some`

**Visible hypotheses:**
- `dec: eK -> ctxt -> ptxt option`

**Memory translation:**
- memories in play: `{1}`, `{2}`
- Decorations identify the program memory from which a term is read.

**Close with:**
- `smt(<lemmas>)` — discharge with the right lemmas (YOU pick them)
- `rewrite <eq>` / `move=> <intro>` — normalise the goal first
- `case (<cond>)` — split a disjunction / membership in the goal

**Yours:** the lemmas for `smt`, the rewrite chain, the case condition — `lookup_symbol` any operator above for its definition and lemmas.

## Status
remaining **8** · phase `relational_program` / `ambient_logic`

_(full untruncated view: `latest_workspace_view.json`)_

**Last action:** `have enc_corr_eq: forall _k _p, equiv [E.enc ~ E.enc : ={glob E, k, p} /\ k{1} …` — EasyCrypt accepted the committed tactic. (The committed EasyCrypt proof state changed.)

Compaction recovery: if these exact paths are missing from your context, refresh through `submit_proof_intent` with `{"intent":"inspect_context","payload":{"topic":"goal_info"}}` instead of using shell directory discovery for proof-state artifacts.

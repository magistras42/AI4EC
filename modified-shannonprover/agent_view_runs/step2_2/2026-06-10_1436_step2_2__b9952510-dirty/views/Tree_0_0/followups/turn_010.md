## Call Frontier

**Situation:** no named-call candidate at this frontier.

**Frontier:**
- setup before the frontier (positions 1–1) — absorb with `sp`/`wp`: RealOrcls(StLSke(St)).init()
- frontier: both sides at `b <@ CCA_CPA_Adv(A, RealOrcls(StLSke(St))).main()`

**Options:**
- `call (_: <Inv>)` — relate the two calls under a relational invariant `<Inv>`
- `inline*` / `proc` — step into the callee body
- `swap` / `transitivity` / `eager` — reorder or commute a statement ACROSS the call (an eager argument; see `tactic_forms` for the exact `eager`/`swap` shape)

**Yours:** which family fits this goal — relate the call, step into it, or reorder a statement across it.

## Status
remaining **4** · phase `relational_program` / `call_site`

**Last action:** `proc.` — EasyCrypt accepted the committed tactic. (The committed EasyCrypt proof state changed.)

Submit exactly ONE proof intent via the `submit_proof_intent` MCP tool (only `intent` + `payload`; no node ids, hashes, request ids, or reasoning fields).

Compaction recovery: if these exact paths are missing from your context, refresh through `submit_proof_intent` with `{"intent":"inspect_context","payload":{"topic":"goal_info"}}` instead of using shell directory discovery for proof-state artifacts.

The current goal is shown in full above. Only-if-needed: the complete structured view (every collapsed panel) is in `LEGAL_LATEST_WORKSPACE_VIEW`.

## Pure Logic — close with smt / rewrite

**Goal operators:**
- `size`
- `ns`
- `Mem.lc`
- `StLSke.gs`
- `RO.m`
- `undup`
- `map`
- `ciphertext`

**Visible hypotheses:**
- `Hns: ns{2} = undup (map (fun (p : ciphertext) => p.`1) Mem.lc{2})`
- `Hf: forged{2} = false`
- `Hi: i{2} = 0`
- `Hlc: Mem.lc{1} = Mem.lc{2}`
- `Hgs: StLSke.gs{1} = RO.m{2}`

**Alignment gap to feed smt:** [{"signal": "local_membership_decomposition_available", "confidence": "medium", "gap": "Visible membership sources carry local case facts that can expose the key, projection, or witness relation, but those source facts …

**Memory translation:**
- memories in play: `{1}`, `{2}`
- Decorations identify the program memory from which a term is read.

**Close with:**
- `smt(<lemmas>)` — discharge with the right lemmas (YOU pick them)
- `rewrite <eq>` / `move=> <intro>` — normalise the goal first
- `case (<cond>)` — split a disjunction / membership in the goal

**Yours:** the lemmas for `smt`, the rewrite chain, the case condition — `lookup_symbol` any operator above for its definition and lemmas.

## Status
remaining **3** · phase `relational_program` / `ambient_logic`

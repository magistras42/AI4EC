### Need more? submit one of these read-only requests
- No fresh recommendation is available; parse the current goal.
  submit `{"intent": "inspect_context", "payload": {"topic": "goal_info"}}`
- The current procedure frontier exposes a call route.
  submit `{"intent": "inspect_context", "payload": {"topic": "call_site_options"}}`
- You are considering `call (_: Inv)` and already have a concrete invariant expression you want to test first.
  submit `{"intent": "inspect_context", "payload": {"topic": "call_subgoals", "invariant": "<the EasyCrypt invariant expression inside call (_: ...)>"}}`
- Need the valid form for call, while, seq, rnd, or rewrite.
  submit `{"intent": "inspect_context", "payload": {"topic": "tactic_forms", "name": "call"}}`
- valid `sp` forms and common traps
  submit `{"intent": "inspect_context", "payload": {"topic": "tactic_forms", "name": "sp"}}`
- Need the valid one-sided hoare/phoare loop form.
  submit `{"intent": "inspect_context", "payload": {"topic": "tactic_forms", "name": "while"}}`
- Mid-proof suffix may need indexed `wp` to absorb a tail before a cut.
  submit `{"intent": "inspect_context", "payload": {"topic": "tactic_forms", "name": "wp"}}`
- Statement order may need a small `swap` before `sp` or `wp`.
  submit `{"intent": "inspect_context", "payload": {"topic": "tactic_forms", "name": "swap"}}`
- A guarded branch may need `rcondt` after a case split or invariant fact.
  submit `{"intent": "inspect_context", "payload": {"topic": "tactic_forms", "name": "rcondt"}}`
- A guarded branch may need `rcondf` after a case split or invariant fact.
  submit `{"intent": "inspect_context", "payload": {"topic": "tactic_forms", "name": "rcondf"}}`
- A suffix proof may need `conseq` to weaken the pre/postcondition before closing.
  submit `{"intent": "inspect_context", "payload": {"topic": "tactic_forms", "name": "conseq"}}`
- A sampling step may need `rnd` to reduce it to a distribution/probability fact.
  submit `{"intent": "inspect_context", "payload": {"topic": "tactic_forms", "name": "rnd"}}`

**Last action:** `byphoare => //.` — EasyCrypt accepted the committed tactic. (The committed EasyCrypt proof state changed.)

Submit exactly ONE proof intent via the `submit_proof_intent` MCP tool (only `intent` + `payload`; no node ids, hashes, request ids, or reasoning fields).

Compaction recovery: if these exact paths are missing from your context, refresh through `submit_proof_intent` with `{"intent":"inspect_context","payload":{"topic":"goal_info"}}` instead of using shell directory discovery for proof-state artifacts.

The current goal is shown in full above. Only-if-needed: the complete structured view (every collapsed panel) is in `LEGAL_LATEST_WORKSPACE_VIEW`.

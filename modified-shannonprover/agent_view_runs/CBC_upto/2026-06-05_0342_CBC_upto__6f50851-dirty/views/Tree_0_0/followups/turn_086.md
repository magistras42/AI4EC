## Pure Logic — close with smt / rewrite

**Goal shape:** quantified ambient tail

**Obligation families:**
- `sampling_bijection` — The remaining pure goal may include invertibility or lossless side conditions from an ear… (seen: distribution or lossless token remains visible) (NOT: No distribution lemma is selected by this surface.)
- `quantified_residual_logic` — The current proof point is dominated by local logical obligations rather than program-fro… (seen: universal quantifier visible; implication residual visible) (NOT: Quantifier names are not normalized across EasyCrypt pretty-printer v…)

**Memory translation:**
- memories in play: `{&1}`, `{2}`
- Decorations identify the program memory from which a term is read.

**Close with:**
- `smt(<lemmas>)` — discharge with the right lemmas (YOU pick them)
- `rewrite <eq>` / `move=> <intro>` — normalise the goal first
- `case (<cond>)` — split a disjunction / membership in the goal

**Yours:** the lemmas for `smt`, the rewrite chain, the case condition.

## Status
remaining **4** · phase `ambient_logic` / `ambient_logic`

### Need more? submit one of these read-only requests
- No fresh recommendation is available; parse the current goal.
  submit `{"intent": "inspect_context", "payload": {"topic": "goal_info"}}`
- Need local or standard-library lemma names before rewriting a pure goal.
  submit `{"intent": "inspect_context", "payload": {"topic": "lemma_hints"}}`
- Need the valid EasyCrypt form for rewrite, apply, conseq, while, or SMT setup.
  submit `{"intent": "inspect_context", "payload": {"topic": "tactic_forms", "name": "rewrite"}}`

_(full untruncated view: `latest_workspace_view.json`)_

Submit exactly ONE proof intent via the `submit_proof_intent` MCP tool (only `intent` + `payload`; no node ids, hashes, request ids, or reasoning fields).

### Manager result (previous turn)
- you submitted: `commit_tactic` `proc; while (0 <= i <= size p) (size p - i).`
- result: Committed tactic accepted; the EasyCrypt proof state changed.

Compaction recovery: if these exact paths are missing from your context, refresh through `submit_proof_intent` with `{"intent":"inspect_context","payload":{"topic":"goal_info"}}` instead of using shell directory discovery for proof-state artifacts.

The current goal is shown in full above. Only-if-needed: the complete structured view (every collapsed panel) is in `LEGAL_LATEST_WORKSPACE_VIEW`.

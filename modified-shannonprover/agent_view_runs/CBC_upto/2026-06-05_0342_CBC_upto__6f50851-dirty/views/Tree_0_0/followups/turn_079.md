## ⚠️ Deep Surgery — decompose, don't grind the whole goal

**Route:** decompose this large goal; don't transform the whole thing at once.

**Toolbox:**
- `case:` the divergent branch, then `rcondt`/`rcondf` to force guards.
- `conseq(:_==> ={<few equal vars>})` + `sim` on the identical prefix.
- `wp` (incl. `wp -N -N`) to absorb tails before `call`/`sim`.

**Yours:** which guard to `case`/`rcond`, the coupling, the smt lemmas.

## Status
remaining **4** · phase `procedure_frontier` / `procedure_body`

Submit exactly ONE proof intent via the `submit_proof_intent` MCP tool (only `intent` + `payload`; no node ids, hashes, request ids, or reasoning fields).

### Manager result (previous turn)
- you submitted: `probe_tactic` `proc; while (DoubleQuery.bad <=> DoubleQuery.bad{2}); inline*; auto; smt().`
- result: Read-only tactic probe. Use any goal-after-probe text as a preview only; there is no probe step to undo.

Compaction recovery: if these exact paths are missing from your context, refresh through `submit_proof_intent` with `{"intent":"inspect_context","payload":{"topic":"goal_info"}}` instead of using shell directory discovery for proof-state artifacts.

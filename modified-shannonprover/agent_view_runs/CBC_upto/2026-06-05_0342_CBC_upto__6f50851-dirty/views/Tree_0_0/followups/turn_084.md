## ⚠️ Deep Surgery — decompose, don't grind the whole goal

**Route:** decompose this large goal; don't transform the whole thing at once.

**Toolbox:**
- `case:` the divergent branch, then `rcondt`/`rcondf` to force guards.
- `conseq(:_==> ={<few equal vars>})` + `sim` on the identical prefix.
- `wp` (incl. `wp -N -N`) to absorb tails before `call`/`sim`.

**Yours:** which guard to `case`/`rcond`, the coupling, the smt lemmas.

## Status
remaining **3** · phase `procedure_frontier` / `procedure_body`

### Manager result (previous turn)
- you submitted: `inspect_context`
- result: Read-only context. Accepted/rejected tactic or call text inside a preview is route-selection information, not the current proof-state error.

Use when: One-sided phoare/probabilistic loop: the proof is already inside a `phoare` obligation and the loop needs both an invariant and a decreasing integer measure. Example: while (0 <= j <= N /\\ oflist s = restr x j) (N - j). Note: Do not append `: p`, `(p)`, or any probability argument. The second parenthesized argument is the termination measure; EC generates the probability/body side obligations after this step. Form 2: while (INVARIANT). Use when: Symmetric while: both sides have while loops that advance together. Invariant holds between iterations. Example: while (={p, c, i, n} /\\ OCC.gs{1} = RO.m{2}); auto. Form 3: while{1} (INVARIANT) (TERMINATION). Use when: One-sided while on LHS: LHS has a while, RHS doesn't (or has already been processed). Provide INVARIANT (holds each iteration) AND a TERMINATION measure (strictly decreasing integer that reaches 0 to end the loop). Example: while{1} (0 <= i <= n) (n - i).

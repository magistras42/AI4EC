## Call Frontier — set up the call invariant

**Situation:** the candidate named call is NOT callable at this frontier yet — blocker: `residual_after_call_site`; so step into the body or write a manual invariant.

**Candidate:**
- `lemma`

**Frontier:**
- setup before the frontier (positions 1–1) — absorb with `sp`/`wp`: RealOrcls( GenChaChaPoly( OpCCinit.OCC(I_stateless))).init()
- frontier: both sides at `b <@ A( RealOrcls( GenChaChaPoly( OpCCinit.OCC(I_stateless))`

**Options:**
- `call (_: <Inv>)` — cross the call with a relational invariant (YOU write `<Inv>`)
- `inline*` / `proc` — step into the callee body instead of crossing

**Yours:** the invariant predicate; whether to cross (`call`) or step in (`inline*`).

## Status
remaining **2** · phase `seq_cut` / `call_site`

- Need parsed goal shape, resolved names, or KB pattern hints.
  submit `{"intent": "inspect_context", "payload": {"topic": "goal_info"}}`
- The current cut or frontier context may expose a call route.
  submit `{"intent": "inspect_context", "payload": {"topic": "call_site_options"}}`
- You are considering `call (_: Inv)` and already have a concrete invariant expression you want to test first.
  submit `{"intent": "inspect_context", "payload": {"topic": "call_subgoals", "invariant": "<the EasyCrypt invariant expression inside call (_: ...)>"}}`
- The visible cut may depend on LHS/RHS statement alignment or missing live facts.
  submit `{"intent": "inspect_context", "payload": {"topic": "align"}}`
- Need the valid form for call, seq, while, rnd, or rewrite.
  submit `{"intent": "inspect_context", "payload": {"topic": "tactic_forms", "name": "call"}}`
- The visible cut/frontier may need indexed `sp i j` before branch tactics.
  submit `{"intent": "inspect_context", "payload": {"topic": "tactic_forms", "name": "sp"}}`
- Mid-proof pRHL suffix surgery may need indexed `wp`.
  submit `{"intent": "inspect_context", "payload": {"topic": "tactic_forms", "name": "wp"}}`
- Statement order may need a small `swap` before `sp`, `wp`, or `sim`.
  submit `{"intent": "inspect_context", "payload": {"topic": "tactic_forms", "name": "swap"}}`
- A guarded branch may need `rcondt` after a case split or invariant fact.
  submit `{"intent": "inspect_context", "payload": {"topic": "tactic_forms", "name": "rcondt"}}`
- A guarded branch may need `rcondf` after a case split or invariant fact.
  submit `{"intent": "inspect_context", "payload": {"topic": "tactic_forms", "name": "rcondf"}}`
- A suffix proof may need `conseq` to weaken to a smaller relation before `sim`.

- One side may have an extra sample or need an explicit sample coupling.
  submit `{"intent": "inspect_context", "payload": {"topic": "tactic_forms", "name": "rnd"}}`
- A known statement-order mismatch may need an eager/lazy transformation.

_(full untruncated view: `latest_workspace_view.json`)_

---

Submit exactly ONE proof intent via the `submit_proof_intent` MCP tool (only `intent` + `payload`; no node ids, hashes, request ids, or reasoning fields).

### Manager result (previous turn)
- you submitted: `commit_tactic` `inline{2} D(A, IndBlock).guess.`
- result: Committed tactic accepted; the EasyCrypt proof state changed.

```json
{"turn":19,"handled_intent":{"intent":"commit_tactic","payload":{"tactic":"inline{2} D(A, IndBlock).guess."}},"ok":true,"manager_note":"Committed tactic accepted; the EasyCrypt proof state changed.","manager_actions":[{"action":"tactic commit","outcome":"EasyCrypt accepted the committed tactic.","timing":"1.3 s"}],"view_refreshed":true}

Compaction recovery: if these exact paths are missing from your context, refresh through `submit_proof_intent` with `{"intent":"inspect_context","payload":{"topic":"goal_info"}}` instead of using shell directory discovery for proof-state artifacts.

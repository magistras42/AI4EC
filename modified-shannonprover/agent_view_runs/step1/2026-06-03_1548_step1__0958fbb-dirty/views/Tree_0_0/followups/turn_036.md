## ⚠️ Deep Surgery — decompose, don't grind the whole goal

**Route:** decompose this large goal; don't transform the whole thing at once.

**Toolbox:**
- `case:` the divergent branch, then `rcondt`/`rcondf` to force guards.
- `conseq(:_==> ={<few equal vars>})` + `sim` on the identical prefix.
- `wp` (incl. `wp -N -N`) to absorb tails before `call`/`sim`.

**Yours:** which guard to `case`/`rcond`, the coupling, the smt lemmas.

## Status
remaining **2** · phase `seq_cut` / `procedure_body`

- Need parsed goal shape, resolved names, or KB pattern hints.
  submit `{"intent": "inspect_context", "payload": {"topic": "goal_info"}}`
- The current cut or frontier context may expose a call route.
  submit `{"intent": "inspect_context", "payload": {"topic": "call_site_options"}}`
- You are considering `call (_: Inv)` and already have a concrete invariant expression you want to test first.
  submit `{"intent": "inspect_context", "payload": {"topic": "call_subgoals", "invariant": "<the EasyCrypt invariant expression inside call (_: ...)>"}}`
- The visible cut may depend on LHS/RHS statement alignment or missing live facts.
  submit `{"intent": "inspect_context", "payload": {"topic": "align"}}`
- Need the valid form for call, seq, while, rnd, or rewrite.
  submit `{"intent": "inspect_context", "payload": {"topic": "tactic_forms", "name": "call"}}`
- The visible cut/frontier may need indexed `sp i j` before branch tactics.
  submit `{"intent": "inspect_context", "payload": {"topic": "tactic_forms", "name": "sp"}}`
- Mid-proof pRHL suffix surgery may need indexed `wp`.
  submit `{"intent": "inspect_context", "payload": {"topic": "tactic_forms", "name": "wp"}}`
- Statement order may need a small `swap` before `sp`, `wp`, or `sim`.
  submit `{"intent": "inspect_context", "payload": {"topic": "tactic_forms", "name": "swap"}}`
- A guarded branch may need `rcondt` after a case split or invariant fact.

- A guarded branch may need `rcondf` after a case split or invariant fact.
  submit `{"intent": "inspect_context", "payload": {"topic": "tactic_forms", "name": "rcondf"}}`
- A suffix proof may need `conseq` to weaken to a smaller relation before `sim`.

- One side may have an extra sample or need an explicit sample coupling.
  submit `{"intent": "inspect_context", "payload": {"topic": "tactic_forms", "name": "rnd"}}`
- A known statement-order mismatch may need an eager/lazy transformation.

_(full untruncated view: `latest_workspace_view.json`)_

---

Submit exactly ONE proof intent via the `submit_proof_intent` MCP tool (only `intent` + `payload`; no node ids, hashes, request ids, or reasoning fields).

### Manager result (previous turn)
- you submitted: `commit_tactic` `call poly_mac1. auto. if => //. wp. call chacha_enc1. auto. auto.`
- result: Committed tactic accepted; the EasyCrypt proof state changed.

```json
{"turn":36,"handled_intent":{"intent":"commit_tactic","payload":{"tactic":"call poly_mac1. auto. if => //. wp. call chacha_enc1. auto. auto."}},"ok":true,"manager_note":"Committed tactic accepted; the EasyCrypt proof state changed.","manager_actions":[{"action":"tactic commit","outcome":"EasyCrypt accepted the committed tactic.","timing":"292 ms"}],"view_refreshed":true}

Compaction recovery: if these exact paths are missing from your context, refresh through `submit_proof_intent` with `{"intent":"inspect_context","payload":{"topic":"goal_info"}}` instead of using shell directory discovery for proof-state artifacts.

The current goal is shown in full above. Only-if-needed: the complete structured view (every collapsed panel) is in `LEGAL_LATEST_WORKSPACE_VIEW`.

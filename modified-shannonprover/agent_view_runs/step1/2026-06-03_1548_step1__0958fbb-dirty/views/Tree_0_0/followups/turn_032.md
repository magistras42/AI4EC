Submit exactly ONE proof intent via the `submit_proof_intent` MCP tool (only `intent` + `payload`; no node ids, hashes, request ids, or reasoning fields).

### Manager result (previous turn)
- you submitted: `probe_tactic` `proc. inline{1} GenChaChaPoly(OpCCinit.OCC(I_stateless)).dec. sp. seq 1 1 : (t'{1} = t'{2…`
- result: Read-only tactic probe. Use any goal-after-probe text as a preview only; there is no probe step to undo.

Compaction recovery: if these exact paths are missing from your context, refresh through `submit_proof_intent` with `{"intent":"inspect_context","payload":{"topic":"goal_info"}}` instead of using shell directory discovery for proof-state artifacts.

The current goal is shown in full above. Only-if-needed: the complete structured view (every collapsed panel) is in `LEGAL_LATEST_WORKSPACE_VIEW`.

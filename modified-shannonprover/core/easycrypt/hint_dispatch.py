"""Hint generation dispatcher — Layer-1 of the 4-layer hint pipeline.

The 4-layer hint generation pipeline (see
``memory/project_hint_generation_design.md`` and the design notes in
the README) splits prover hint production into:

  Layer 1 — Hint Source: produce candidate tactics from the goal
            (deterministic, no LLM, no daemon).
  Layer 2 — Daemon Verification: probe each candidate via
            ``daemon.try_tactic`` and stamp epistemic status.
  Layer 3 — ProofContextView Surface: route accepted candidates into
            canonical prover actions.
  Layer 4 — Confidence-aware Surface: ladder runnable / probe / hint
            by confidence so the agent can override.

Until this module landed, every Layer-1 producer was a hand-rolled
``CommitPhase`` that re-implemented its own gate, daemon loop, and rec
shape. New shapes (e.g. ``AbstractAdvCallHintPhase``,
``SwapAlignHintPhase``) duplicated that machinery. This dispatcher
centralizes:

  * goal-shape gating via ``applies_to_shape`` → no per-phase if/elif
  * the daemon-verify gate (Layer 2) so every generator gets the same
    epistemic stamping
  * the ``HookResult`` rec shape so generators only need to produce
    ``Candidate`` tuples

Existing legacy phases (``PivotStrategyPhase``, ``AutoDiffPhase``,
``AutoSigPhase``) are left in place to avoid a risky big-bang refactor;
new generators should be added by registering a ``HintGenerator``
implementation here and the dispatcher will wire it into the commit
pipeline automatically.

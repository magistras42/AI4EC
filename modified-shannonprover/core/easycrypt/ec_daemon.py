"""Persistent EasyCrypt daemon: keeps one ``easycrypt -emacs`` subprocess
per session alive across tactic submissions, enabling fast speculative
execution (try tactic → rollback) without the 5-15s per-call re-spawn +
history-replay overhead session_cli currently pays.

Transport: Unix socket at ``/tmp/ec_daemon.sock``. Framing:
    newline-delimited JSON objects, one request/response per line.

Multi-prover: a daemon holds N concurrent sessions, one EC subprocess
each (indexed by session_id string). Different sessions can execute
concurrently (separate threads); same session serializes via a
per-session lock. This supports tree-mode provers (prover_tree_0_0,
prover_tree_0_1, ...) running in parallel.

Protocol (minimal JSON-RPC-ish):
    {method: str, session_id: str, params: dict}
    → {status: "ok"|"error", result: ..., error: ...}

Methods:
    open_session(file_path, include_dirs, lemma_name): create EC
        subprocess, load context.ec from the matching session_dir, step
        into the lemma's proof, return current goal state.
    commit(tactic): advance permanently, append to history, return new
        goal state.
    try_tactic(tactic): execute, capture outcome, auto-undo. Return
        {accepted, error, goal_state_preview}. Session state unchanged.
    batch_try([tactic1, ...]): each tactic tried independently, all
        undone. Returns list of per-tactic results.
    get_goal(): current goal state.
    undo(): revert last committed tactic (for -prev equivalent).
    list_sessions(): active session ids.
    close_session(): terminate EC subprocess.
    shutdown(): stop daemon.

Errors: if EC hits an error line (e.g. ``[error-N-M]cannot ...``), the
response's ``error`` field carries:
    {kind: "unification_fail"|"no_progress"|"unknown_lemma"|
           "type_error"|"other",
     raw: str, location: dict?}

Rollback semantics: ``try_tactic`` always runs ``undo.`` after the
tactic, regardless of whether the tactic succeeded. If EC considers a
failing tactic as "no state change", the undo becomes a no-op; if EC
did advance state briefly before reporting an error, the undo brings it
back. Either way, history is unchanged.

Scope for this initial version: single-host, trust all local clients,
no auth. Persistence across daemon restart is NOT supported — a
restart wipes all sessions (clients reopen).

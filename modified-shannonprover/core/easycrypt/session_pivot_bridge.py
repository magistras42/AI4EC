"""Pr-bridge suggestion engine (AUTO-BRIDGE-SUGGEST): typed Pr-bridge frontend candidates, named-bridge fallback, up-to-bad call coherence.

Extracted verbatim from PivotStrategyPhase (session_hook_phases.py) — the
2,900-line inspect-engine god-class. Each function's first parameter is
named ``self`` ON PURPOSE: it receives the PivotStrategyPhase instance
(for ``self.session`` and the small shared helpers that stay on the
class), so the bodies are byte-identical to the original methods and the
panel-invariance guarantee holds. De-self-ifying the signatures into
explicit params is a follow-up, not part of this carve.
